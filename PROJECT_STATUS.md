# TastyReport Project Status

## Project Overview
TastyReport is a full-stack application for managing and analyzing TastyTrade transactions, built with:
- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- Frontend: Next.js 15 with TypeScript
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Authentication: Supabase

## Current Status

### Backend Status
- ✅ FastAPI backend structure is in place
- ✅ Database models and schemas are defined
- ✅ TastyTrade integration is implemented
- ⚠️ Environment configuration needs proper setup
- ⚠️ Database connection needs to be verified

### Frontend Status
- ✅ Next.js project structure is in place
- ✅ Authentication context and provider are implemented
- ⚠️ Missing package.json and dependencies
- ⚠️ AuthProvider needs "use client" directive
- ⚠️ Frontend-Backend communication needs to be established

## Configuration Requirements

### Backend Configuration
1. Required environment variables in `.env`:
   ```
   SECRET_KEY=
   POSTGRES_SERVER=
   POSTGRES_USER=
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=
   POSTGRES_DB=
   ENCRYPTION_KEY=
   ```

2. Backend startup command (from project root):
   ```bash
   cd app && source ../.venv/bin/activate && PYTHONPATH=$PWD/.. uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
   ```

### Frontend Configuration
1. Required environment variables in `frontend/.env.local`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
   ```

2. Frontend startup command (from frontend directory):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Known Issues

### Backend
1. Module import error when running from wrong directory
2. Missing environment variables causing validation errors
3. Python path needs to be set correctly for imports

### Frontend
1. Missing package.json and node_modules
2. AuthProvider needs to be marked as client component
3. Webpack cache issues
4. Missing AuthProvider file in correct location

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Backend:
   - [ ] Verify all environment variables are set
   - [ ] Test database connection
   - [ ] Verify TastyTrade integration still works
   - [ ] Test transaction import functionality

2. Frontend:
   - [ ] Set up package.json and install dependencies
   - [ ] Fix AuthProvider client component issue
   - [ ] Implement transaction display interface
   - [ ] Set up API communication with backend

### Integration Tasks
1. [ ] Test frontend-backend communication
2. [ ] Implement transaction sync with TastyTrade
3. [ ] Add error handling and loading states
4. [ ] Implement proper authentication flow

```

## Development Workflow
1. Start backend first:
   ```bash
   cd app
   source ../.venv/bin/activate
   PYTHONPATH=$PWD/.. uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
   ```

2. Start frontend in a new terminal:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

## Notes
- Backend must be running on port 8000
- Frontend will run on port 3000
- Ensure all environment variables are properly set before starting either service
- Python virtual environment must be activated for backend
- Node modules must be installed for frontend

## Questions to Resolve
1. Are all required environment variables documented?
2. Is the database schema up to date?
3. Are there any specific TastyTrade API requirements that need to be documented?
4. Are there any specific frontend design requirements or mockups?
