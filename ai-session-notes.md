# AI Agent Session Notes (2024-06-10)

## Session Summary

- **TastyTrade API integration is complete.**
- All tests pass individually and sequentially (see `scripts/run_tests_sequentially.sh`).
- macOS resource fork files (`._*`) were identified, cleaned up, and are now ignored via `.gitignore`.
- Pydantic v2 migration is finished: all `class Config` and `orm_mode` usages replaced with `model_config = ConfigDict(...)`.
- Pre-commit hooks are enforced and all files are clean.
- The codebase is up-to-date with modern FastAPI, async SQLAlchemy, and robust test/dev workflow.
- All changes are committed and pushed to GitHub (`main` branch).

## Key Commands & Artifacts
- **Sequential test runner:** `scripts/run_tests_sequentially.sh`
- **Pre-commit hooks:** run automatically on commit
- **GitHub repo:** https://github.com/bostrovsky/tastyreport02

## Next Steps
- [ ] Start with deployment automation (e.g., Docker, CI/CD)
- [ ] Add more edge case tests for TastyTrade sync (e.g., rare symbol types, API downtime)
- [ ] Review and improve API documentation
